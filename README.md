# WIP: WhatsApp Web Frontend

## Objectives

This project acts as a refresh for re-learning frontend web development with best practices and modern tooling. With the fast-paced front-end development area, the tools that we used last year might be replaced with better tools in the next years.

I plan to build a WhatsApp Web Frontend focusing on the app architecture, UI, state management, and testing. Most of the work here is the real world scenario when you are building a frontend web app.

## Tech stacks

- Vite for the build tool
- Vitest for testing framework
- React for the frontend UI library
- Jotai for react state management
- TailwindCSS for the CSS framework
- Shadcn UI for Base UI
- Mock Service Worker for the mock API server
- Storybook for component library
